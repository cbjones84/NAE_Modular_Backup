## 📋 Files Created

### Core System
- `agents/ralph_github_research.py` - Main research engine (20KB)
- `agents/ralph_github_continuous.py` - Continuous research loop
- `start_ralph_github_research.sh` - Quick start script
- `RALPH_GITHUB_RESEARCH.md` - Complete documentation

### Integration
- Integrated into `nae_autonomous_master.py`
- Auto-starts with NAE production mode
- Auto-restarts on failure

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: One-Time Research
```bash
# Full research (all categories)
python3 agents/ralph_github_research.py --full

# Specific category
python3 agents/ralph_github_research.py --category options_trading
```

### Option 2: Continuous Research
```bash
# Start continuous research (runs every 24 hours)
./start_ralph_github_research.sh

# Or manually
python3 agents/ralph_github_continuous.py
```

### Option 3: With GitHub Token (Recommended)
```bash
# Set token for better rate limits
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

# Run research
python3 agents/ralph_github_research.py --full
```

**Get GitHub Token:**
1. GitHub → Settings → Developer settings
2. Personal access tokens → Generate new token
3. Select `public_repo` scope
4. Copy token and use above

## 📊 How It Works

### 1. Search Phase
- Searches GitHub for relevant repositories
- Uses GitHub API (respects ToS, not scraping)
- Filters by language (Python), stars, relevance

### 2. Analysis Phase
- Downloads and analyzes code files
- Scores code quality (0-100)
- Identifies useful patterns:
  - Algorithms
  - ML/AI components
  - Risk management
  - Profit optimization

### 3. Implementation Phase
- Auto-implements high-quality code (score ≥ 70)
- Extracts useful functions/classes
- Saves to `agents/generated_scripts/github_improvements/`
- Tracks to avoid duplicates

### 4. Integration Phase
- Improvements available for NAE use
- Can be tested in dev environment
- Deployed to production when validated

## 📁 Output Locations

### Research Results
- Location: `logs/github_research/research_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`
- Contains: Repository info, analysis results, scores

### Implemented Improvements
- Location: `agents/generated_scripts/github_improvements/improvement_*.py`
- Contains: Extracted code, source attribution, metadata

### Logs
- Main log: `logs/ralph_github_research.log`
- NAE log: `logs/nae_autonomous_master.log`

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Rate Limits

**Without Token:**
- 60 requests/hour
- Slower research
- May need delays

**With Token:**
- 5,000 requests/hour
- Faster research
- More comprehensive

### Research Interval
- Default: 24 hours
- Configurable in `ralph_github_continuous.py`

### Quality Threshold
- Auto-implement: Score ≥ 70
- Configurable in `ralph_github_research.py`

---

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Check Status
```bash
# Research process
ps aux | grep ralph_github

# Recent results
ls -lt logs/github_research/

# Implemented improvements
ls -lt agents/generated_scripts/github_improvements/

# View logs
tail -f logs/ralph_github_research.log
```

### View Results
```bash
# Latest research
cat logs/github_research/research_*.json | jq '.'

# Implemented improvements
cat agents/generated_scripts/github_improvements/improvement_*.py
```
