# Neural Agency Engine (NAE) - Project Summary

## Project Overview

The Neural Agency Engine (NAE) is a fully automated, multi-agent AI system designed for automated trading and operations, with the goal of achieving generational wealth through intelligent, risk-managed trading strategies.

## Key Objectives

1. **Generational Wealth**: Build a system that creates and maintains wealth across generations
2. **$5M Goal**: Generate $5,000,000 within 8 years, consistently every 8 years
3. **Optimized Trading**: Focus on successful options trading with automated decision-making

## System Architecture

### Multi-Agent System

NAE consists of specialized AI agents, each with distinct responsibilities:

- **Optimus**: Live trading and execution
- **Ralph**: Strategy generation and learning
- **Donnie**: Strategy validation and testing
- **Shredder**: Commerce and Bitcoin operations
- **Splinter**: Coordination and orchestration
- **Phisher**: Security and penetration testing
- **Casey**: Agent building and monitoring
- **Genny**: Financial planning and generational wealth
- **April**: Crypto operations
- **Leo**: Compliance
- **Mikey**: Risk management
- **Bebop**: System monitoring

### Technical Stack

- **Languages**: Python 3.11, JAX, PyTorch
- **Execution**: LEAN (self-hosted), QuantTrader/PyBroker, NautilusTrader
- **Brokers**: Schwab (primary), IBKR, Tradier (with failover)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Redis, PostgreSQL
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **AI/ML**: THRML (Thermodynamic Machine Learning), Ensemble models, RL frameworks

## Key Features
