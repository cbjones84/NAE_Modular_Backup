## Conference Abstract Example

**Title**: Neural Agency Engine: A Multi-Agent AI System for Automated Trading

**Authors**: [Your Name] (Co-Author & Lead Architect), [Other Contributors]

**Abstract**:  
We present the Neural Agency Engine (NAE), a fully automated multi-agent AI system for trading and operations. NAE employs 12 specialized agents for strategy generation, execution, risk management, and operations. The system integrates THRML for probabilistic models, supports multiple execution engines with automatic failover, and implements comprehensive risk controls. This work demonstrates the application of multi-agent systems and probabilistic AI to automated trading.
